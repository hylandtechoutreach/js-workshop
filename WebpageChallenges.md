## HTML Challenge: Adding an Image
1. In the HTML section, add an `h2` saying "A Cool Image"
1. Beneath the `h2`, add an `img` element to the page
    - This will not do anything yet...
1. Search for an image of a cat using Google Images in Chrome
1. Right click and select **Copy image address**
    - Do not click **Copy image**, that will not work!
1. Add a `src` attribute to the `img` element, and paste in the URL for the image

**HTML**
```html
<h2>A Cool Image</h2>
<img src="your_url_here">

**CSS**
```css
img {

1. Start with `if`
1. Add parentheses (`()`)
1. Within the parentheses, compare the `finalScore` to `100` with a double-equals sign
