## HTML Challenge: Adding an Image
1. In the HTML section, add an `h2` saying "A Cool Image"
1. Beneath the `h2`, add an `img` element to the page
    - This will not do anything yet...
1. Search for an image of a cat using Google Images in Chrome
1. Right click and select **Copy image address**
    - Do not click **Copy image**, that will not work!
1. Add a `src` attribute to the `img` element, and paste in the URL for the image
1. Finally, in the CSS section, select the `img` element and set the `height` so that it fits on the page

```html
<h2>A Cool Image</h2>
<img src="https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzEwNC84MTkvb3JpZ2luYWwvY3V0ZS1raXR0ZW4uanBn">
```

```css
img {
    height: 200px;
}
```

## CSS Challenge:

## JavaScript Challenge: Adding a Question
1. Update the value of the `numberOfQuestions` variable to be `3` instead of `2`
1. Underneath the `}` for the second `if` statement, add a new line
1. Ask the user a third question using `prompt`, and store the user's answer in a variable named `answer3`
    - Ask any appropriate question!
1. Add an `if` statement checking if the user entered the correct answer
1. If the user _did_ enter the correct answer, increase their points!
1. Add more additional questions if desired!

## JavaScript Challenge: Final Message
Instead of simply showing the final score to the user, display a message about the score. For example, if they score 100%, display a message that says "Good Job!"
